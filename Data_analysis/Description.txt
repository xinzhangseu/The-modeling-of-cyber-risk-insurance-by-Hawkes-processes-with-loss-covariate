All data used in this paper are the format of .rda that can be recognized by R.
The data prc_hack.rda is a subset of the original PRC dataset,  which  includes all breaches

The datasets prc_hack_bus_arr.rda and prc_hack_med_arr.rda are the time series that 
the breaches recorded,  here we consider them the occurrence time of the breaches.

The datasets prc_hack_bus_arr_interval.rda and prc_hack_med_arr_interval.rda are the
 interarrival times that are mainly used for modeling.
